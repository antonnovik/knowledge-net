               "If a SLOT-CARDINALITY of relation R with respect to a domain
class C is N, then for all instances c of class C, R maps c to exactly
N individuals in the range.  For single-valued relations, the
slot-cardinality is 1.  Specifying a SLOT-CARDINALITY is a constraint
between classes and binary-relations which does not always hold; there
need not be any fixed value-cardinality for R on all instances of C.")
