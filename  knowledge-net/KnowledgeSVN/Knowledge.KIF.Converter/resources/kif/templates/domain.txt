(documentation domain
               "DOMAIN is short for ``domain restriction''.  A domain restriction
of a binary relation is a constraint on the exact-domain of the
relation.  A domain restriction is superclass of the exact-domain;
that is, all instances of the exact-domain of the relation are also
instances of the DOMAIN restriction.  Thus, the DOMAIN of a relation 
is not unique.
   In an ontology, specifying a domain restriction of a binary
relation is a way to specify partial information about the objects 
to which the relation applies.  For example, one can state that
favorite-beer is a relation from beer drinkers to beers as
 (domain favorite-beer person).  This says that all people who have
a favorite-beer are instances of person, even though there may be some
instances of person who do not have a favorite beer.
   Representation systems can use these specifications to classify terms and
check integrity constraints.")
