               "Single-valued relations are binary relations that are functional.
The predicate SINGLE-VALUED is useful for asserting that a slot will
have at most one value without using a function-defining form.  It is
restricted to binary relations because it is defined only for slots.
Note that specifying a relation as single valued says that it is
function for _all_ subclasses of its domain.")
