(documentation instance-of
               "An object is an instance-of a class if it is a member of the set
denoted by that class.  One would normally state the fact that
individual i is an instance of class C with with the relational 
form (C i), but it is equivalent to say (INSTANCE-OF i C).  
Instance-of is useful for defining the second-order relations and
classes that are about class/instance networks.
  An individual may be an instance of many classes, some of which may be
subclasses of others.  Thus, there is no assumption in the meaning
of instance-of about specificity or uniqueness.  See
DIRECT-INSTANCE-OF.")
