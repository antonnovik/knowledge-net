               "ALL-VALUES is a way to state all of the the values of a slot 
on an instance. Its third argument is a set.  If all-values are given
for a slot on an instance, there cannot be any other values for that 
slot on that instance.  For example, (= (ALL-VALUES i R) (setof v_1 v_2 v_3))
means that R(i,v_1), R(i,v_2), and R(i,v_3) hold, and there is no other 
unique v_i for which R(i,v_i) holds.")
