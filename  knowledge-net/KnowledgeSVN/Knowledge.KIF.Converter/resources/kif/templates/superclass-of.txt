(documentation superclass-of
               "Superclass-of is the inverse of the subclass-of relation.
It is useful to create an explicit inverse because
there are efficient ways to assert and query superclass and subclass
relationships separately. 
  In Cyc, superclass-of is called #%allSpecs because it is a slot from
a collection to all of its specializations (subclasses).")
