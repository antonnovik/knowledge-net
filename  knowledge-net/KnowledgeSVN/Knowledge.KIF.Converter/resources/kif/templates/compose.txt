(documentation compose
               "arbitrary-arity version of COMPOSITION.  The left-to-right
argument order composes relations outside-in.  
e.g., (COMPOSE f g h) means (composition h (composition g f)).
If the relations are unary functions, then the composition order
corresponds to nested function terms.  For example, if f,g,h are functions,
then (value (COMPOSE f g h) ?arg) is equivalent to (f (g (h ?arg))).")
