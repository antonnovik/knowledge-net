(documentation arity
               "Arity is the number of arguments that a relation can take.  If a
relation can take an arbitrary number of arguments, its arity is
undefined.  For example, a function such as `+' is of undefined arity;
its last formal argument is specified with a sequence variable.  The
arity of a function is one more than the number of arguments it can
take, in keeping with the unified treatment of functions and
relations.  The arity of the empty relation (i.e., with no tuples) is
undefined.")
