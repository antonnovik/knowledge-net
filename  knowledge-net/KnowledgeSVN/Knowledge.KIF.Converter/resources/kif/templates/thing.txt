(documentation thing
               "THING is the class of everything in the universe of discourse that
can be in a class.  This includes all the relations and objects
defined in the KIF specification, plus all other objects defined in
user ontologies.  Every THING is either a simple-set or an individual.
  There are entities in the universe of discourse for KIF that cannot
be instances of THING.  These entities are unbounded objects, which by
definition cannot be members of any set.  Since THING is a class,
and classes are relations, and relations are sets, then unbounded
entities can't be instances of any class.
  That is why THING is defined here, as the practical root of all
ontologies.")
