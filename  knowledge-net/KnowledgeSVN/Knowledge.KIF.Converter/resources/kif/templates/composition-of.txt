(documentation composition-of
               "A binary relation R is a COMPOSITION-OF a sequence of binary relations 
R_1, R_2, ... R_N iff there exists a relation R' that is a COMPOSITION-OF
the sequence R_1 ... R_{N-1}, and R is the (COMPOSITION R_1 R').
  Relations are composed right to left.  For example,
if (composition-of R (listof a b c d))
then R = (composition d (composition c (composition b a))).
  When the relations are unary functions, the sequence corresponds to
nested parentheses in functional notation.  For example, if F is
composition-of functions a, b, and c, (COMPOSITION-OF F (listof a b c))
means (f ?x) is equal to (a (b (c ?x))).")
