(documentation function
               "A function is a mapping from a domain to a range that associates a
domain element with exactly one range element.  The elements of the
domain are tuples, as in relations.  The range is a class -- a set of
singleton tuples -- and element of the range is an instance of the
class.  Functions are also first-class objects in the same sense that
relations are objects: namely, functions can be viewed as sets of
tuples.")
