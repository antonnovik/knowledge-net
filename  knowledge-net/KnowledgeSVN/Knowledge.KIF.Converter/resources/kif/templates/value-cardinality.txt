               "The VALUE-CARDINALITY of a binary-relation with respect to a given
domain instance is the number of range-elements to which the relation
maps the domain-element.  For a function (single-valued relation), the
VALUE-CARDINALITY is 1 on all domain instances for which the function
is defined.  It is 0 for those instances outside the exact domain of
the function.
  VALUE-CARDINALITY may be used within the definition of a class to
specify a slot cardinality if its first argument is the class's
instance variable.")
