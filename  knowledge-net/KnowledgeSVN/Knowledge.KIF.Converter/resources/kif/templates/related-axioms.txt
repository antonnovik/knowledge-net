(documentation related-axioms
               "Related-Axioms is a relation that maps any object in the domain of
discourse to a KIF sentence related to that object.  KIF sentences can
be denoted by quoted expressions.  The object is not necessarily a
symbol.  It is usually a class or relation or instance of a class.
Therefore Related does not mean that the object is mentioned in the
axiom, and there is no syntactic test for relatedness.")
